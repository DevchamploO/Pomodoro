This is a timer is a utility to help manage time when working on the computer. It uses the pomodoro technique. With this technique, time on task is broken into short intervals spaced with break periods in between. For example, for every 25 minutes of work you are given 10 minutes for a break. These intervals are called pomodoros.

The amount for time for work and rest can be customized as needed. The timer can be paused or reset.
